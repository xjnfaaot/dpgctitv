		<p>What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now? After supper, which was served by the steward, mute and impassible, I went to bed, not without some anxiety. As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels. I saw many kinds which I never before had a chance of observing. With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back, the other is fastened to the waist. It is composed of a Bunsen pile, which I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium. A wire is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs it toward a particularly made lantern. In this lantern is a spiral glass which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas. When the apparatus is at work, this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous light. Thus provided, I can breathe and I can see.</p>

The captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel. In the midst of the glade, on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up, stood a cross of coral, that extended its long arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood. You are right, Conseil.</p>

		<p>You are following the chain of events? asked Captain Nemo. Professor, said this strange man, you must excuse the unceremonious way in which I receive you, and the disorder of this room. Well? I asked, not catching the captain's idea. Certainly, sir.</p>
